- Built SynapseFlow: an extensible multi-agent framework with planning (ToT), memory, adaptive tool selection, and streaming LLM support.
- Implemented OpenAI streaming integration and demo, Qdrant memory adapter, tool generator, and a FastAPI service with SSE-style streaming.
- Created demo scripts, Docker + docker-compose for Qdrant, CI-ready tests, and an end-to-end README for quick deployment and evaluation.

- Rebranded to SynapseFlow AI; added frontend with token-based demo auth and SSE streaming; integrated OpenAI embeddings into Qdrant for semantic memory.
